abstract: "Thiol-mediated uptake (TMU) is thought to occur through dynamic covalent cascade exchange networks. Here we show that the cascade accounting for TMU of asparagusic acid derivatives (AspA) ends in the Golgi apparatus (G) and shifts from disulfide to thioester exchange with palmitoyl transferases as the final exchange partner. As a result, AspA combined with pH-sensitive fluoresceins, red-shifted silicon-rhodamines, or mechanosensitive flipper probes selectively labels the Golgi apparatus in fluorescence microscopy images in living and fixed cells. AspA Golgi trackers work without cellular engineering and excel with speed, simplicity, generality, and compatibility with G/ER and cis/trans discrimination, morphological changes, anterograde vesicular trafficking, and superresolution imaging by stimulated emission depletion microscopy. Golgi flippers in particular can image membrane order and tension in the Golgi and, if desired, at the plasma membrane during TMU."
