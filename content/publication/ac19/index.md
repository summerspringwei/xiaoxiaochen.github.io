abstract: 
  'Nitric oxide (NO) and glutathione (GSH) have
interplaying roles in oxidant-antioxidant balance. In this work,
we developed the ﬁrst example of a single ﬂuorescent probe that
displayed a turn-on ﬂuorescence response toward NO and GSH
from dual emission channels. The probe was synthesized by
introducing 4-amino-3-(methylamino)-phenol to a BODIPY
scaﬀold. Speciﬁcally, the NO-mediated transformation of
diamine into a triazole triggered the ﬂuorescence in the green
channel, and the GSH-induced SN Ar substitution reaction led to
the red-shifted emission in the red channel. The probe was
successfully applied to detect the exogenous and endogenous
NO and GSH in macrophage cells. More importantly, the probe
revealed that NO induced by interferon-γ (IFN-γ), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and L -arginine (L -Arg) could also elicit the
augmentation of intracellular GSH. We anticipate the probe would hold great potential for investigating the redox balance in
biological processes.'
