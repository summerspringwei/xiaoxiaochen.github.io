abstract: 
  'A fluorometric/colorimetric dual-channel chemo-
sensor based on a hydrazine-substituted BODIPY probe has been
successfully fabricated for the detection of RDX and PA. The
chemosensor displays turn-on fluorescence behavior upon RDX
with a detection limit of 85.8 nM, while showing a turn-oﬀ
response to PA with a detection limit of 0.44 μM. Meanwhile, an
obvious color diﬀerence is observed by the naked-eye after the
reaction for RDX. Thus, in application, a two-to-two logic gate is
constructed for potential application in explosives detection.
Additionally, portable equipment is also developed for in situ
determination of RDX.'
