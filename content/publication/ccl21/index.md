abstract: 
  "Evaluating the correlation between hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and nitric oxide (NO) generated under hypoxia is of great significance. In this work, we developed a fluorescent probe for the monitor of HIF-1 activity influenced by NO under hypoxia in hepatoma cells with dual-targeting for hepatocyte and lipid droplet (LD). The probe shows excellent selectivity to NO and high sensitivity with 6000-fold fluorescence enhancement. Live cell imaging experiments revealed the probe's capability of imaging exogenous and endogenous NO with specific in LDs of HepG2 cells. For cells under hypoxia, HIF-1 induced LD level is observed to correlate with NO level. This work provides the in-situ visualization of NO-dependent HIF-1 upregulation through LD accumulation."
