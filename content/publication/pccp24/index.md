abstract: 
  'The design, synthesis and evaluation of a subphthalocyanine-flipper (SubPc-Flipper) amphiphilic dyad is
  reported. This dyad combines two fluorophores that function in the visible region (420–800 nm) for the
  simultaneous sensing of both ordered and disordered lipidic membranes. The flipper probes part of the
  dyad possesses mechanosensitivity, long fluorescence lifetimes (t = 3.5–5 ns) and selective staining of
  ordered membranes. On the other hand, subphthalocyanines (SubPc) are short-lifetime (t = 1–2.5 ns)
  fluorophores that are insensitive to membrane tension. As a result of a Fo ¨rster Resonance Energy Trans-
  fer (FRET) process, the dyad not only retains the mechanosensitivity of flippers but also demonstrates
  high selectivity and emission in different kinds of lipidic membranes. The dyad exhibits high emission
  and sensitivity to membrane tension (Dt = 3.5 ns) when tested in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) with
  different membrane orders. Overall, the results of this study represent a significant advancement in the
  applications of flippers and dyads in mechanobiology.'
