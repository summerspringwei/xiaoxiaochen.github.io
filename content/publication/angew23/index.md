abstract: 
  'Flipper probes have been introduced as small molecule fluorophores to image physical forces, that is,
membrane tension in living systems. Their emergence over one decade is described, from evolution in design and
synthesis to spectroscopic properties. Responsiveness to physical compression in equilibrium at the ground state is
identified as the ideal origin of mechanosensitivity to image membrane tension in living cells. A rich collection of flippers
is described to deliver and release in any subcellular membrane of interest in a leaflet-specific manner. Chalcogen-
bonding cascade switching and dynamic covalent flippers are developed for super-resolution imaging and dual-sensing of
membrane compression and hydration. Availability and broad use in the community validate flipper probes as a fine
example of the power of translational supramolecular chemistry, moving from fundamental principles to success on the
market.'
