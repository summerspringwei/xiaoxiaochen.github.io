abstract: 
  'Glutathione (GSH)-activated prodrugs are promising for overcoming the limitations
  of conventional anti-tumor drugs. However, current GSH-responsive disulfide
  groups exhibit unregulated reactivity, making it impossible to precisely control the
  drug release rate. We herein report a series of GSH-responsive prodrugs with a
  “three-in-one” molecular design by integrating a fluorescence report unit, stimuli-
  responsive unit and chemodrug into one scaffold with tunable aromatic nucleo-
  philic substitution (SNAr) reactivity. The drug release rate of these prodrugs is
  tailored by modification of substituent groups with different electron-withdrawing or
  -donating abilities on the BODIPY core. Furthermore, the prodrugs self-assemble in
  water to form nanoparticles that serve as photosensitizers to produce reactive oxygen
  species upon irradiation for photodynamic therapy (PDT). The PDT process also
  increases the concentration of GSH in cells, further promoting the release of drugs for
  chemotherapy. This strategy provides a powerful platform for sequential photody-
  namic and chemotherapy with tunable drug release rates and synergistic therapeutic
  effects.'
