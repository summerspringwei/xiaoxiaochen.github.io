abstract: 
  'Progress with fluorescent flippers, small-molecule probes to image
  membranetensioninlivingsystems,hasbeenlimitedbytheeffortneededtosynthesize
  the twisted pushâˆ’pull mechanophore. Here, we move to a higher oxidation level to
  introduce a new design paradigm that allows the screening of flipper probes rapidly, at
  best in situ. Late-stage clicking of thioacetals and acetals allows simultaneous
  attachment of targeting units and interfacers and exploration of the critical
  chalcogen-bonding donor at the same time. Initial studies focus on plasma membrane
  targetinganddevelopthechemicalspaceofacetalsandthioacetals,fromacyclicamino
  acids to cyclic 1,3-heterocycles covering dioxanes as well as dithiolanes, dithianes, and
  dithiepanes, derived also from classics in biology like cysteine, lipoic acid, asparagusic acid, DTT, and epidithiodiketopiperazines.
  From the functional point of view, the sensitivity of membrane tension imaging in living cells could be doubled, with lifetime
  differencesinFLIMimagesincreasingfrom0.55to1.11ns.Fromatheoreticalpointofview,thecomplexityofmechanicallycoupled
  chalcogen bonding is explored, revealing, among others, intriguing bifurcated chalcogen bonds.'
