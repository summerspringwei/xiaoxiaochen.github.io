abstract: 
  'Clarifying the signaling pathway associated with nitric oxide (NO)
  and glutathione (GSH) in cardiovascular disease therapy is important for
  understanding its physiological and pathological processes but is challenging due
  to the lack of eﬃcient analytical techniques. Herein, we report a BODIPY-based
  ﬂuorescent probe for recognition of NO and GSH in sequence with high
  sensitivity and selectivity. The probe exhibits turn-on ﬂuorescence triggered by
  NO, followed by red-shifted emission in the presence of GSH. The sequentially
  activated mechanism allows the visualization of NO-induced GSH upregulation
  in drug-treated endothelial cells and zebraﬁsh for the ﬁrst time, revealing a signal
  pathway during the therapy. We hope that it can be used as a convenient and
  eﬃcient tool for the study of the interplay between NO and GSH and for the
  screening of eﬀective drugs for cardiovascular disease therapy.'
